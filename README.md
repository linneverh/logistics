## How to Use the Project

You can find the data we used to conduct our analysis in this [Data file](https://github.com/linneverh/logistics/tree/main/Data).The [distance matrix](https://github.com/linneverh/logistics/blob/main/Data/final_driving_distance_matrix_km.csv) that was used in our models can be found there.

For the coding part, we have divided the work into 2 code files that you can directly run via the [Code file](https://github.com/linneverh/logistics/tree/main/Code) of the github repository: 

- [The EDA code](https://github.com/linneverh/logistics/blob/main/Code/Data_EDA.ipynb). 
- [The code for our CVRPs and the FLP](https://github.com/linneverh/logistics/blob/main/Code/CVRP_FLP_2ndCRVP_BASIC.ipynb).
